### üìä Environmental Data Cleansing & Visualization

This repository documents a complete data analysis workflow, from taking a raw, potentially 'dirty' dataset, cleaning it thoroughly using **Pandas**, and then transforming the resulting data into insightful visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

### ‚ú® Features

The project focuses on a two-step process to ensure a robust and visually compelling analysis.

#### **1. Data Cleansing Pipeline**

* **Handling Missing Data:** A rigorous process was implemented to identify and manage missing or null data points within the dataset, ensuring data integrity.
* **Data Integrity Check:** Correcting data types and ensuring consistency across all records.
* **Ready-for-Analysis Output:** The primary goal of this phase was to transform the raw data into a clean, structured format, making it suitable for high-quality visualization and statistical analysis.

#### **2. Data Visualization**

* **Diagram Generation:** Uses Python to generate various diagrams, including:
    * Time-series plots to track environmental variables (e.g., average temperature, rainfall) over time.
    * Distribution plots to understand the frequency of different metrics (e.g., wind speed).
    * Scatter plots and correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.<br>
* **Reproducible Analysis:** All cleaning and visualization steps are contained within the `825230176.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, making the entire analysis process transparent and easy to reproduce.
